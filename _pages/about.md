Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a PhD student of the [QICI group](https://qici.weebly.com/) at the Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong (HKU). I obtained my M.Sc. in Physics at ETH Zurich and my B.Sc. in Physics at Peking University.

I work on quantum information theory. My research interests include quantum metrology, quantum control and quantum foundations.
